## 📦 What I Built  

This is a **data analytics project** that:  

✅ Reads HR employee data from CSV  
✅ Cleans and processes the dataset  
✅ Visualizes workforce demographics, satisfaction, and attrition  
✅ Provides actionable HR insights for retention & planning  
✅ Fully reproducible in a Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧠 Why I Built This  

HR teams often have large amounts of employee data but lack **clear, visual insights** to drive decision-making.  
This project helps HR professionals see **patterns, trends, and risk areas** quickly through visual analysis.

## 🔨 Built With  

- 🐍 Python  
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy  
- 🎨 Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook
